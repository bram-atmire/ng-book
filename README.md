# ng-book 2: The Complete Guide to Angular 4 Sample Code - Personal Examples

## Organization

Hi! Here's the sample code for the ng-book 2.

It's organized by `chapter/topic`. Generally, in the book the authors call out where you can find each code example. 

I'm trying to do each of the exercises myself, and only push the code I actually wrote or changed, and not just the folders with the solutions.

## Running the code

Check the `README` in each project's directory to learn how to run the code. Generally every project is built on [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), which means they have a consistent toolchain for building and running. To run these projects do the following:

```bash
cd path/to/project
npm install 
npm start 
```

Then open the project in your browser. Generally at the URL http://localhost:4200
